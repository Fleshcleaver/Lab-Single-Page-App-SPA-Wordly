This is an SPA that looks up words via an API. It goes to https://dictionaryapi.dev/ and returns the meaning of the word. It handles empty words and also invalid words.

This is the first version of the code.

Future version ideas:
Add colors based on word type
Save searches and add a counter for popular words
